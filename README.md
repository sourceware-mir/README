Here lays a set of mirrors for some sourceware.org projects.

The reason for these mirrors are -

1. Some of these projects are only available in bzip2 form, and while bzip2
   is a fine compression format it clearly lags behind gzip and XZ for
   this genre of software, and placing on github.com allows for download of
   other formats.

2. Roughly a zillion people like to fork on github.com and this provides a
   trusted base to work from.

The NUMBER ONE rule for these mirrors is, if a tag exists on both
sourceware.org and github.com, the content of that tag is identical.
